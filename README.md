# hybrid-cloud-infra-project
Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure project using AWS, Azure, Terraform, Docker, Networking, and CI/CD.

🌥️ Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure Project

🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design and deploy a Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure using real-world tools and engineering practices across:

AWS (EC2, VPC, Security Groups)

Azure (Linux VM, Virtual Network)

Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

Docker (Containerization)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD Pipeline)

Linux Administration

Networking (subnets, routing, firewalls)

Monitoring + Logging

This portfolio project reflects the work I’m capable of doing as a Cloud / DevOps Engineer.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Cloud Providers

Infrastructure as Code

DevOps & Automation

Languages & OS




✨ Purpose of This Project

This is a hands-on, multi-cloud engineering project I am building to:

Strengthen my cloud infrastructure experience

Demonstrate real DevOps automation

Build and manage resources across AWS and Azure

Apply Terraform IaC to provision cloud resources

Practice networking architecture (VPC, VNet, routing, firewalls)

Develop CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions

Handle real-world deployment structure and documentation

My goal is to present a complete, professional-level portfolio project that shows employers exactly what I can build.

🧱 Architecture (High-Level)

A diagram will be added here in Day 3.

Planned design:

AWS VPC connected to Azure VNet

EC2 instance + Azure Linux VM

Terraform provisioning across both clouds

CI/CD pipeline managing deployments

Monitoring layer (CloudWatch + Azure Monitor)

Hybrid = both cloud environments working together in one architecture.
